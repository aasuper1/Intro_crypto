\addchap{Abstract}
Centralization is an issue that has begun to arise in major cryptocurrency solutions as the creation of mining pools, cost of mining hardware, and hoarding of currency has increased overtime. In this paper, we are going to determine whether Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies tend to become centralized over time or not. To do so, we used agent-based modeling to run simulations of various configurations of Proof-of-Stake systems, such as Delegated Proof-of-Stake, Extended Proof-of-Stake, and Pure Proof-of-Stake to observe the collection of wealth over time. Finally, we tried to find an improvement to the proof-of-stake system with our own design, called Raffle Proof-of-Stake.
