1. Good old Gini Index

2. resources being unequally distributed

3. concentration

4.decentralzation in e-POS paper: offers mining opportunitues to wider set of stakeholders

k (final miner list) < c (candidate miner) < n (total miner)
beta = k/n, measure how beta changed

- want large number of people that can be choosen large k/n
- among people participate, who are likely to win
- % of wealth (NEED MORE DISCUSSION)

"""
1.Gini Coefficient
the Gini coefficient is half the average difference of incomes between each all possible pairs of individuals, divided by the mean income
Or 
The space between y = x and he Lorenz curve -  share of total income earned by the lowest-earning portion of the population 

2. Theil L index
Capture the change of total utility 
Utility function U(x) = Log(x), and calculate the change of 
Sum Log (X_i)

3.Herfindahl-Hirschman index
Measure the economic concentration 
Sum(X^2)/(Sum X_i)^2


3. Nakamoto coefficient: 
the minimum number of participants needed to add up to more than 50% of the total

- visualize each how the income change over time with scattered plot
