We made a simple agent based model to test the decentralization and security of current variation of POS. 


## About POS
In Proof of Stake is a variation of consensus algorithms of distributed systems. 
The goal is to 1)maintain a shared record with the presence of malicious participants 2)

### miners
selected miner for an transaction $\subset$ all miners $\subset$ participants

## rewards 

## Modeling decentralization and decurity of POS Consensus Algorithms

- the numbered file are implementation of different POS mechanism
- the models are 
- security.py analyze common security 
- decentralization_analytics.py analyze 4 different matric of wealth decentralization
- the notebook are used for visualizations

Our framework runs as follows:
- each 


## Limitation
- sophisticated attacks such as grinding attacks are not discussed in the security analysis. It's possible that new design can be gamed with well-targetted attacks
- We only discussed wealth centralization, more specifically, the nartually emerging pattern of rich get richer and eventually take over the network.
