We made a simple agent based model to test the decentralization and security of current variation of POS. 


## About POS
In Proof of Stake

### miners
$\subset$

## Consensus Algorithms and analytics 

- the numbered file are implementation of different POS mechanism
- the models are 
- security.py analyze common security 
- decentralization_analytics.py analyze 4 different matric of wealth decentralization
- the notebook are used for visualizations

Our framework runs as follows:
- each
